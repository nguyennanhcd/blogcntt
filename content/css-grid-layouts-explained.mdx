CSS Grid has revolutionized how we approach web layouts. Once you understand its core concepts, you'll find it to be an incredibly powerful and flexible tool.

The grid container and grid items form the foundation. When you set display: grid on a container, all direct children become grid items. Define your grid structure with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.

The fr unit is your friend. It represents a fraction of available space, making responsive layouts easier. 1fr is equivalent to one part of the available space, so grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr creates two equal columns.

Grid lines are the numbered lines around your grid. Using grid-column and grid-row, you can place items at specific locations. The auto keyword is handy for automatically placing items based on the grid's flow.

Named grid areas offer semantic and readable code. With grid-template-areas, you can visualize your layout as a text pattern, making it self-documenting.

For responsive grids, combine CSS Grid with media queries. You can change your grid structure at different breakpoints to optimize for different screen sizes.

Auto-placement is powerful. The browser automatically places items based on the grid flow. Control this behavior with grid-auto-flow and grid-auto-rows/grid-auto-columns.
