Accessibility is not an afterthought in web design—it's a fundamental principle that ensures your content reaches and serves everyone. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore practical techniques and real-world examples to help you build interfaces that are truly inclusive.

The importance of accessible design cannot be overstated. When you design with accessibility in mind, you're not only helping people with disabilities—you're improving the experience for everyone. From keyboard navigation to screen reader optimization, these practices make interfaces more usable for all users.

Let's start with the basics. Semantic HTML is your foundation. Using proper heading hierarchies, alt text for images, and meaningful link text ensures that assistive technologies can properly interpret your content. These simple practices can have a profound impact on accessibility.

Color contrast is another crucial element. Aim for at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between text and backgrounds. This helps users with low vision and makes content readable in various lighting conditions. Tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker can help you verify your ratios.

Form accessibility often gets overlooked, but it's critical. Always associate labels with form inputs, provide clear error messages, and indicate required fields. ARIA attributes can enhance your forms' accessibility when used correctly.

Testing is essential. Use keyboard navigation to ensure all interactive elements are reachable. Test with screen readers like NVDA or JAWS. Conduct user testing with people who have disabilities—they'll provide invaluable insights.
