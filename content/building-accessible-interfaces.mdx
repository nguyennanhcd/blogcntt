# Accessibility is not an afterthought

When you design with accessibility in mind, you improve the experience **for everyone**.

  Semantic HTML is your foundation.

## Color contrast

Aim for **4.5:1** contrast ratio. Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker.

## Form accessibility

- Associate `<label>` with inputs
- Clear error messages
- ARIA when needed
